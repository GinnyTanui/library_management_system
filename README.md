Django Library Management System

This is my Django capstone project that implements a Library Management System with custom authentication and role-based access.

Features

Custom User Model with roles: Admin, Librarian, and Member (default).

User Authentication: Register, login, and logout using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system.

User Profile Management: Each user has a profile that can be updated.

Signals: Automatically creates a profile when a new user registers.

Role-Based Permissions: Different access levels for Admin, Librarian, and Member.

Token-Based API Authentication (in progress).

Books App (coming soon): Manage books and connect with users.
